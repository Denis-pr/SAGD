Steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) is a thermal enhanced oil recovery method.

Machine learning algorithms (MLA) for different tasks in field development and enhancement oil recovery optimization find their application in recent years. For better performance of SAGD was analysed different technological parameters of process such as temperature of steam, distance between wells, injection rate. Machine learning algorithm – Random Forest (RF) – was implemented for optimization technological parameters of SAGD through searching of maximum of objective function – Net Present Value (NPV). Optimization was provided through reservoir simulation with tNavigator reservoir simulation software and conjugate internal Python script of MLA. Optimization of SAGD using MLA provide better performance of EOR method and can maximize of NPV.
